#### So you have a new product or service? You are not sure how to promote it online?

## The Problem

When launching a new product, it is sometimes hard to know in advance what key features will be the most appealing to our future customers and how to promote our product. So let's test some variants! This is called A/B testing.

## Setting Up The Test

In our case, our SaaS File Transfer Solution has many interesting features. The test consist to select 6 prominent features of the product and create a landing page for each. Each page will focus on the selected prominent feature first, but also mention the other features. On each page, we have a "Free Trial" form inviting our prospect to try the product.

- [Affordable File Sharing Solution](/en/saas/file-transfer/affordable-file-sharing-solution/)
- [Scalable File Sharing Solution](/en/saas/file-transfer/scalable-file-sharing-solution/)
- [File Sharing Automation Solution](/en/saas/file-transfer/file-sharing-automation-solution/)
- [Effortless File Transfer Solution](/en/saas/file-transfer/effortless-file-transfer-solution/)
- [Reliable File Transfer Solution](/en/saas/file-transfer/reliable-file-transfer-solution/)
- [Secure File Sharing Solution](/en/saas/file-transfer/secure-file-sharing-solution/)

## Measuring The Results

Measuring the number of signup from each landing page is the easiest way to measure the interest in the feature. With tools like Google Analytics, we can make even more detailed analysis.

## Speeding up the process

Once the test is running, we may realize we do not get much visits to our site. With paid advertizing, we can speed things up. We just have to create 1 Ad for each variant of the landing page.
