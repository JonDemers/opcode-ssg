My [application development company](https://opcodesolutions.com/) just got a new website. It shows more relevant information and has a lean design powered by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). It is now hosted on [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). If you need a software for your business, call us. We will discuss your project and weâ€™ll give you a free quote, see our [pricing](https://opcodesolutions.com/en/pricing/) and [application hosting packages](https://opcodesolutions.com/en/hosting/). All the applications we develop [run on desktop, tablet and smartphone out of the box](https://opcodesolutions.com/en/demo/index.html).

Alright, enough bragging, back to work now!
