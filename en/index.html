      <h1>Software for Businesses</h1>
      <p>When you need more than a website and blog, we are the one to call. We develop custom applications from A to Z and
        provide hosting as needed. This is our job, we are good at it and we love it.</p>

          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Accessible
        </h2>
        <p>Embrace the present and access your application from any device: desktop, tablet, mobile. No matter when and where
          you are, you can keep an eye on your business and get things done. All you need is an internet-enabled device.</p>

        <h2>
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Affordable
        </h2>
        <p>We have very competitive prices. Our secret: we spent years at perfecting our skills and we carefully chose every
          single piece of our technology stack. We save time, you save money. Tell us what you need and we will quote a price, for
          free.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>No technical skills required. Get peace of mind with managed hosting. We take care of backing up your data, applying
          system updates, managing load and more. We know you have better things to do with your time. Focus on your business, not on
          your servers.</p>
