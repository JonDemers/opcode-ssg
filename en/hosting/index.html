    <h1>Hosting</h1>
    <p>We develop your application and we know how to host it. Whether you choose our managed hosting or prefer your own infrastructure, we fully support both options. The right choice depends on your specific needs and is discussed during your free consultation.</p>

    <br />

    <h2>Managed Hosting</h2>
    <p>With managed hosting, we handle all the technical complexity so you can focus on your business. No technical knowledge is required on your end. Your application runs on our infrastructure, primarily hosted in Canada, with the option to deploy to any AWS region worldwide to meet your data residency requirements.</p>

    <p>Our infrastructure is designed to be fast and performant. We select the right sizing for your needs, whether you have ten users or ten thousand. Your application will respond quickly and reliably.</p>

    <p>Your application runs 24/7 with small and infrequent maintenance windows scheduled outside of Eastern Time business hours. Should a longer maintenance be required, we will communicate with you in advance. We can also accommodate specific maintenance window requirements if your business operates on a different schedule.</p>

    <p>Your data is protected through regular backups or real-time replication depending on your needs. We apply system updates regularly to keep your application secure and running on the latest stable software. The level of isolation between your application and others can be tailored to match your security, compliance, and budget needs.</p>

    <h2>Hosting on your Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>If you already have your own cloud or on-premises infrastructure, we can deploy your application there instead. Many organizations have existing investments in their own data centers or cloud accounts, and it often makes sense to leverage that infrastructure.</p>

    <p>We fully support the deployment process and provide everything you need to run the application in your environment. Your team manages the infrastructure while we ensure the application is properly configured and running smoothly.</p>

    <p>This choice is not permanent. You can always change your mind later and migrate to our managed hosting, or move from our infrastructure to yours. We support migrations in either direction, so you are never locked into a decision.</p>
